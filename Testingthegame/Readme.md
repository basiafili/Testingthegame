# SpaceManagement

A resource management game set up in a deep space scenario. As usual it's supposed to originate in a foreign galaxy. And corporations rule the universe. Or maybe not? You can also encounter some aliens, of course.

## Basic concepts

Every sector of the galaxy is divided into a grid of explorable elements like asteroid fields, habitable planets, alien worlds, big moons, gasious planets and other objects, such as alien bases, alien labs, stargates, dark matter groupings and more. I list more detailed explanations and rules of engagement for more common types. Other would be explored later.

### Asteroid fields

Asteroid maps are divided into smaller cells with some empty spaces too. Here are some rules for the maps in general:

* Every asteroid map has a Transferring Center at top left of screen.
* The coordinates start at top left with the Transferring Center and increase toward right on X axis or toward bottom on Y axis.
* A cell on a map can be empty, have an asteroid, a gas cloud or an alien object of some kind.
* An asteroid or a gas cloud can be small, medium or large. Empty cells or those with alien artifacts on them are not given size.

#### Cells in more details

* Empty cells — allow for complex, self-contained structures like Transferring Center, Trade Port, Space Station or Commercial Port.
* Asteroids — can be different in size (small, medium or large) and can be usually built upon. Asteroids can have many valuable resources such as minerals, gemstones or rare elements like gold, platinium or liquid crystals. Asteroid can be drilled into or explored with other structures you can build on the surface. Typical resources are:
	- mineral ore — non-metalic minerals in raw state.
	- metal ore — typical metals, common on Earth, but with different combinations of elements and usually richer than on Earth.
	- rare elements like gold, silver, platinum, precious gems, radioactive elements or liquid crystals.
	- gas on gas clouds — in larger quantities, but tricky to extract.
	- alien grass — somewhat crazy substance or a form of alien fungus. Except it looks like grass. The more you harvest it, the easier it grows. And it can be extremely useful. At first you can only research it and harvest it, but in time your scientists can find a way to grow it elsewhere or use it in your own facilities.
* Gas clouds — a number of gasious substances can be extracted from a gas cloud. But it's tricky, so the technology to do the job is somewhat expensive.
* Alien structures — these can give you unexpected bonuses of different kind.

## Currently in progress:

## Tutorial mission 1.

First in at least four or five tutorial missions. It is supposed to be a gentle introduction to the game. It is recommended for all players, but is super easy to finish.

### Objectives

The user is supposed to learn how to build simple structures, explore the map and set up basic connections.

To accomplish the mission the user should gather certain amount of basic resources. Easily done but an introductory mission only. Every important skill would be obtained during first few missions, but only with research and acquiring new technologies can the game be won.

### Required components:

In order to have a full map I need to have already prepared certain elements:

* A grid system for a map
* Size type for objects like buildings or other elements
* Typical map resource plans, including what type of cells can be built on or not.
* List of buildings along with sizes, types, requirements, pricing, in/out products etc.
* Connections plan or concepts.
* Some general documentation ideas for the user to browse if need be.
* Some general ideas for symbols/icons/images for map elements and resources along with color plans, so they would be easily recognizable for the user. Including color-coding etc.
* Elementary game mechanics for production, growth etc, so that resources would increase in time, money would be earned, processes would be established etc.

### General map plan and characteristics:

Small grid 3x4 or 4x5 with basic elements such as food, metal ore, non-metal ore, natural gas, basic processors and some artifact or other structure.

First mission is supposed to take place on an asteroid field.
